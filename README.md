Nancy with Make & Mono
======================

- Coded in Nancy
- Compiled with Mono 2.10
- Built with Make 3.81
- Hosted by a Self Contained EXE

I, as of Christmas 2012, got a brand spanking new Macbook Pro.  I have been a windows developer for a while and I wanted to use by knowledge of C# and .NET for good.

So I started for ways to use my Nancy experience within OSX.  I tried to be as compatible as possible.
